# ChurnModeling

The dataset is a fictional dataset from a Bank. The bank has seen an anusual churn rate. They want to understand what problem is and address the problem. 1 is not in the bank and 0 is still in the bank. We have to find rules and correlation to predict which customers have the higher chance of leaving the bank.
